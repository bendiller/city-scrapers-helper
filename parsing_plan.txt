# -------------------------------------------- PARSING THOUGHTS -------------------------------------------------------
I've found the following 3 possible source scenarios:
  1.  Info comes from the "Commission Meeting Schedule for 2019" list (documents meetings scheduled for the year)
  2a. Info comes from the "Commission Meetings" table (documents meetings that already occurred)
  2b. Info comes from the last <tr> in the "Commission Meetings" table, which means it's not a proper row but a bunch
      of <br> lines within the row.

Case #1 and 2(a &b) will be differentiated by a "from_schedule_section" boolean which will change how they're processed.

    def _parse_title(self, item):
    pass # Not yet known

    def _parse_description(self, item):
    if from_schedule_section
        return 'Regular'  # Annual is not differentiated by this code, as it's still a regular meeting.
    # Further parsing of table data to determine Regular/ Committee (Residential)/ Committee (Executive)/ Special/ etc.

    def _parse_start(self, item, from_schedule_section):
        # May not need to provide from_schedule_section at all; might just look for the date text regardless
        # Again, look at chi_pubhealth.py - the _parse_date() method can probably be adapted

        """Parse start datetime as a naive datetime object."""
        return None

    def _parse_links(self, item):
        """Parse or generate links."""
        documents = []
        # Should pretty much just be able to look for item.xpath('a/@href') or similar, see chi_pubhealth.py
        return documents

    def _get_status(self):
        if (self.start > datetime.now()):
            return TENTATIVE
        else:
            return PASSED



Regarding de-duplication, I THINK something like this would work:

# All meetings are stored on this page, with some duplication, so making a list of them and de-dup'ing is needed:
# Here's a couple approaches:
# 1. Fully parse the past ones ("Commission Meetings") first and store Meeting objects in a list.
# 2. Work through the "Schedule" list and do the following:
      a. Parse start - if start is in the list of starts found from #1, cease processing this one ('continue')
      b. Else, finish processing this one
