The purpose of this repo is to be used alongside my work to contribute to the "CityScrapers" project, and to provide
a simple sandbox that lets me test selectors against the HTML source without having to invoke Scrapy or crawl pages or
anything.

I'll paste webpage source HTML into source.html and then play with selectors in selector_sandbox.py.

Issues to address with pjsier:
    1. NEVERMIND - SEE BELOW - No documented times for future meetings (though all past were at 6:30pm)
    2. NEVERMIND - SEE BELOW - (Related to #1) - Documented times for past meetings are in a pdf behind a link.
        --> Can I address that somehow? Should I bother?
    3. Description field - doesn't exist, but could include the date info (January 2019, April 2019, etc.)
    4. Time is not given except in the minutes of previous meetings; I've hard-coded 6:30PM, and a note in time_notes.
    5. Location is not given except in the minutes of previous meetings; I've hard-coded location. Is that acceptable?

    For #1 and 2, I think what I'll do is put 6:30PM as the time, but include time_notes indicating uncertainty.

Gotcha's, to-do, and other things to watch for:

  1. DE-DUPLICATION - Looks like they just post's the year's planned meetings at once in the "Commission Meeting
     Schedule for 2019" section and don't update it until the following year; but when a meeting has passed, it appears
     below, in the "Commission Meetings" section, too, which indicates past meetings.

New files for which I need to run all tests/linting/etc.:
  Created file: C:\ProgProjects\city-scrapers\tests\files\chi_midway_noise.html
  Created file: C:\ProgProjects\city-scrapers\city_scrapers\spiders\chi_midway_noise.py
  Created file: C:\ProgProjects\city-scrapers\tests\test_chi_midway_noise.py



Run individual test:
pytest C:\ProgProjects\city-scrapers\tests\test_chi_midway_noise.py


Run flake8 (linter):
flake8 C:\ProgProjects\city-scrapers\city_scrapers\spiders\chi_midway_noise.py
flake8 C:\ProgProjects\city-scrapers\tests\test_chi_midway_noise.py
(Probably need to do this for all .py files generated, though it will likely stay just those two)


Run isort:
