The purpose of this repo is to be used alongside my work to contribute to the "CityScrapers" project, and to provide
a simple sandbox that lets me test selectors against the HTML source without having to invoke Scrapy or crawl pages or
anything.

I'll paste webpage source HTML into source.html and then play with selectors in selector_sandbox.py.
